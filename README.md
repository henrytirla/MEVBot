# Mev Bot RORðŸ¤–

## âš  ROR Team IS WORK IN PROGRESS!

Currently there is no proper README.md for R.O.R. and I appologize for that. Didn't have time yet to make a proper documentation.
Despite missing documentation you will still find some usefull code when dig a bit around. 

What you find here that may be usefull
* Scripts for a Bot Net to BULK execute transactions from tons of wallet at once (+ managing all the wallets at once via script)

* Load all Uniswap V2/V3 and Suhsiswap Pairs
* Pool filtering based on minimum value
* Route finder (cyclic & direct routes) based on set depth
* Multicall contracts
* Route calculation
* Private transactions via flashbot
* ABIs
* etc. (just look around if u curious)
